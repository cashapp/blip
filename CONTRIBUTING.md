# Contributing to Blip

Blip was designed from the start to be developed and improved by the community.
MySQL monitoring is too extensive and dynamic for one team or company to handle.
For Blip to remain the best and most advanced MySQL monitor, we encourage contributions.

## 1. Sign the Contributor License Agreement

Before Block (Square/Cash App) can accept your code, you must sign the [Individual Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeRVQ35-gq2vdSxD1kdh7CJwRdjmUA0EZ9gRXaWYoUeKPZEQQ/viewform?formkey=dDViT2xzUHAwRkI3X3k5Z0lQM091OGc6MQ&ndplr=1).
If you already signed it for other Block (Square/Cash App) projects, let us know.
It only needs to be signed once.

## 2. Create an Issue

Create an issue to describe the bug fix, feature change, or new feature you want to contribute.
Wait for confirmation from a Cash engineer before writing code to ensure that the contribution
will be accepted if it meets criteria in the next step and passes PR review.

Reproducible bugs are an exception. If you can reliably reproduce a bug, especially by writing a
test case for it, then feel free to start writing code after creating an issue; don't wait for us.

## 3. Fork and Code

[Fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) the repository and make your changes.
Code must meet these criteria:

* Pass all tests
* Be documented
* Be formatted with `go fmt`
* Maintain backward compatibility
* Follow existing conventions and style
* Address only one issue (small PRs)

Other criteria may apply on an issue-by-issue basis.

## 4. PR Review

When you are done, submit a pull request (PR). If you want to submit a PR before the code is
ready for review, prefix the PR description with "[WIP]" and we will ignore it. Else, we
consider all PR ready for review.

A Cash engineer will review the PR and check it against the criteria listed above.
When everything is ready, we will merge the code and close the issue.
